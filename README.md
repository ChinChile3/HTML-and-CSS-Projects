### Movie Theater Website
This is a one page website that would be the home page for a movie theater using bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components, including jumbotron, cards, form, navbar, and dropdowns.

### Space Station Website
This is an example of a one page website for a company looking to send travelers into space. It is styled using CSS and contatins a navbar, image containers and a form.

### Basic one page website
This is a page that has the skeleton for a one page website of a topic of my choice, that being the kingdom of Lothric from the popular video game "Dark Souls 3". It has image containers, a navbar, a form, and an embedded video.

### Portfolio Website
This is a one page website that contains a link to my GitHub account, and acts as my portfolio for the work I have accomplished at The Tech Academy. It is styled using CSS, and has a navbar, images, a video in the background, and a form.
